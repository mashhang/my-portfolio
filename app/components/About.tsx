        I’m a passionate and curious computer science graduate with a strong
        love for creating clean and functional web apps. My main stack includes
        Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Prisma, and Supabase. Aside from coding, I enjoy
        gaming, listening to music, and watching movies. I’m also always on the
        lookout for ways to learn and grow as a developer.
